# React-Hangman
## A personal project!

If you wanna give it a try! Click [Here](https://glinchflash-lol-hangman.netlify.app)

### mission (personal)
- learning more about React
- Understanding React better
- Getting used to using states/useEffect
- Make a project that I can build upon later when wanted
- Making something fun that I can also use myself from time to time



### What did I Learn
- React uses states to declare variables so when using a normal variable without a state it can cause refreshing of the page without it being necessary.
- Some more hands-on experience with basic React fundamentals.
- That I enjoy React more than I already thought :D


#### completions
- :heavy_check_mark: Creating a functional hangman game
- :heavy_check_mark: Making the hangman figure appear when making errors
- :heavy_check_mark: Including Lol champions (unfortunately couldn't find an API with the data, so it's hard coded )
- :heavy_check_mark: Including a list of letters that show which letters you have left to try
- :heavy_check_mark: Including play again button

#### TODOS / potential idea's
- Making a landing page where people can choose a category which will determine from what kind of category the hidden word will be
- Adding a category that requires the use of an api
- Instead of play again button, have a play again button but also a "choose new category" button.
- Keep track of which words you already guessed out of a category to see if you can complete it.
- Making it look good!!!
